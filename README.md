# Instance Property Iterator
This API iterates and gives out all the properties of an Instance. Supports **some** Instances & Inheritances of a Class.

(This does not use HttpService or MaximumADHD's Roblox API Dump, considering why there are less Instances than expected in this API.)
I'll be adding more anyway.

# Tutorial coming soon, too lazy to add.

# Update v1.1.0.0:

Add more Instances + properties. (They were automatically written by ***AHEM, AI.*** but had no use in the source code whatsoever.)
