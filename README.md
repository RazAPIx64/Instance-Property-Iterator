# Instance-Property-Iterator
This API iterates and gives out all the properties of an Instance. No support for all Instances currently.

(This does not use HttpService or MaximumADHD's Roblox API Dump, considering why there are less Instances than expected in this API.)
I'll be adding more anyway.

# Update v1.1.0.0:

Add more Instances + properties. (They were automatically written by ***AHEM, AI.*** but had no use in the source code whatsoever.)
